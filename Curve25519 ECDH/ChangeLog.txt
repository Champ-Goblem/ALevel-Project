Added domain parameter validation subroutine
Strengthened my import curves from XML to include domain parameter validation
Changed ECIES encryption routine to stop curve generation on the fly, users must now supply curves
Created a function in ECPoint to look for erroneous values, i.e in places I set an ECPoint to -99,-99,-99

Changed from using HMAC to CBC_MAC
Added better error management, no more crashes, hopefully
Added a debug log function, hopefully going to add a debug log file
Changing all throw exception to my new error management system
To make sure that subs exit with pass or failed, added a error system to most subs, if they return a structure I added didError as boolean to make things easier
Anything that returns just a normal type of value, the return will be set null if there is an error
Changed how we use the events_handler class, instead of inheritance, because of problems with retaning values from different classes we no import the class and set everything that is accessible to friend and shared
Changed Encrypt_Sign method in AES.vb and corrected it so that it only takes the last block of the message when doing a CBC_MAC
Added message length at start when doing MAC
Added a method to removed the excess zeros from the end of the plaintext message after decryption.
