Changed main form code so we list interfaces and correspoding addresses
Added validation to check if the interface is currently in use
Had to add a function to convert a string IP address to system.net.ipaddress
Changed the way invoking socketMT works, must now create new then run set_tcplistener_start as no way to do new as a function
Changed the way null return from convert_ip_decimal was handled
Added status to form text that changes, added running and stopped icons
Inherited the tcplistener class and modified it to poll for a user then raise an event when a user is trying to connect
Had to do some stuff with invoking to be able to write to the RTB_Log in the UI due to the fact that MULTITHREADING DOESNT WORK WITH DEFAULT INSTANCES
This required a new shared class as a wrapper for accessing Main thread UI stuff, requires and instance of the thread as a pre-requisite
Created a multithreaded client send and recieve class which multithreads polling for messages and sending data, including locks for netstream
created a class which makes a lookup table for clients, key being the IP of the client and stores the username, public key and reference to the mtClientReciever object that is dealing with that clients connection
Needed to implement a heartbeat for the client to know when the client disconects
Next designed some of the data designs that we would use such as heatbeat values, client disconnect values
Added stuff to close the connections and so
Added correct server shutdown so clearing out the lookup table and disposing of streams and client references and stuff
